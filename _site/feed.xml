        <title>Dealing with Emergencies When You&#39;re Small</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you keep your start-up running &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; fix emergency issues that crop up? How do you do it when you only have 3 developers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the problem we faced quite recently. The Way We Did Things Before™ is the way most small teams deal with issues: when an issue comes in, whoever is the expert in that area would check it out, with the help of the rest of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This had a few issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The whole development team was interrupted for any issue, to figure out who should look at it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experts are a dangerous thing: they mean that parts of the system were only understood by a sinlge person in the team. If they were to be hit with an industry-standard bus, we’d lose any knowledge of the system. The Way We Did Things Before™ made this isolation worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one of our retrospectives we decided we needed to change this. So we did what any reasonable company would do: we bought a stuffed cat-unicorn hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wild-pusheen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A wild Pusheenicorn appears.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Pusheenicorn. It identifies as gender-neutral. It’s our Chief Support Officer, and it’s their role to sit on the desk of the &lt;em&gt;Emergency Support Dude.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emergency Dude is picked in our morning stand-up. During the day, they can be asked by other parts of the business to deal with emergencies. Some days it’s busy, some days it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-it-work&quot;&gt;Does It Work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been running this for a few weeks now, and it seems to work: other developers aren’t getting distracted by issues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One things we forgot to do initially was define what an emergency &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;. This led to a number of “emergencies” that were actually new features, or suggestions for change. In the end, we defined it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An emergency is a technical issue of an existing feature that is stopping our customers or team doing what they want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works for us - anything that isn’t an issue gets put into our product development pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there we go: all you need to do support in a small team is get a unicorn-cat and throw it around a bit. Any questions? &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/HelloTrussle&quot;&gt;Let us know on Twitter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello World</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello!&lt;/strong&gt; We’re the Trussle Product Development Team. We make stuff for &lt;a href=&quot;https://trussle.com/&quot;&gt;Trussle&lt;/a&gt;, a mortgage adviser that wants to change the way you get a mortgage for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thought we needed a website for us to talk about software, technology and other things we like. One or two afternoons later, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re just starting to release some of our cool tools as open source software. When we do, it’ll be on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/trussle&quot;&gt;our Github page&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ll announce it here as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get to know us, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;team profiles&lt;/a&gt;. Better still, send us a message &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HelloTrussle&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you like it!&lt;/p&gt;
