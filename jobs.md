Trussle is a company with big ambitions. We're only small, but you might have heard about us in The Telegraph, The Financial Times or on the BBC. We've secured over Â£1.2M of investment and signed long-term partnerships with Zoopla and uSwitch. Our plans are even bigger. You can find out more about us on [our main site](https://trussle.com).

We're always looking for enthusiastic people to join our team. If you don't fit into one of these roles, we'd still love to hear from you. Get in touch via our e-mail address: [team@trussle.com](mailto:team@trussle.com)

## Roles

### Designer

We think delivering an amazing user experience is how we become the market leader. Our website needs to be beautiful, smooth and easy to understand. We need to supply the right information at the right time. And we need to provide an experience so good that our users will tell their friends about it.

We want Trussle to be a design-driven company, and to do that we need passionate designers in our team to solve problems, direct our visual identity and design user experiences our users love.

We like user-obsessed and experimental designers, proficient with industry tools and skilled at applying design principles to tough problems. We don't need designers who hide away, churning out pixel-perfect designs: we need great collaborators and communicators that are happy to discuss, defend and change their designs with people inside and outside the business.

### Software Engineer

Trussle is built on software; if we weren't, we'd just be another mortgage broker. We're using software and clever thinking to tackle the hard problems in our field. How do you simplify a process as complicated as getting a mortgage? What happens when banks *don't* have APIs? And how do you build a personal service that scales to thousands of applicants per day?

We're always on the look out for talented, self-driven software engineers to join our team and help us build what mortgage advisers will look like in the future.

We prefer analytical, problem-solving mindsets over years of experience. We like to experiment with our tools, architecture and process to make it easier and faster to build things. Communication is key as small companies grow, so we need engineers that are happy to explain, challenge and assess our progress - to their team and to the wider company.

We're a full-stack Javascript house at the moment, but we're not precious about it: we'll use the right tool for the job. We try to work in an agile fashion because it means we can get things done. And have the usual perks like bean bags and stuffed toys.
