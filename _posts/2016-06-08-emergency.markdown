How do you keep your start-up running *and* fix emergency issues that crop up? How do you do it when you only have 3 developers? 

That's the problem we faced quite recently. The Way We Did Things Before™ is the way most small teams deal with issues: when an issue comes in, whoever is the expert in that area would check it out, with the help of the rest of the team.

This had a few issues:

- The whole development team was interrupted for any issue, to figure out who should look at it.
- Experts are a dangerous thing: they mean that parts of the system were only understood by a single person in the team. If they were to be hit with an industry-standard bus, we'd lose any knowledge of the system. The Way We Did Things Before™ made this isolation worse.

At one of our retrospectives we decided we needed to change this. So we did what any reasonable company would do: we bought a stuffed cat-unicorn hybrid.

This is Pusheenicorn. It identifies as gender-neutral. It's our Chief Support Officer, and it's their role to sit on the desk of the *Emergency Support Dude.* 

The Emergency Dude is picked in our morning stand-up. During the day, they can be asked by other parts of the business to deal with emergencies. Some days it's busy, some days it's not.

## Does It Work?

We've been running this for a few weeks now, and it seems to work: other developers aren't getting distracted by issues

One things we forgot to do initially was define what an emergency *was*. This led to a number of "emergencies" that were actually new features, or suggestions for change. In the end, we defined it like this:

> An emergency is a technical issue of an existing feature that is stopping our customers or team doing what they want to do.

This works for us - anything that isn't an emergency gets put into our product development pipeline.

So there we go: all you need to do support in a small team is get a unicorn-cat and throw it around a bit. Any questions? [Let us know on Twitter.](http://twitter.com/HelloTrussle)
